This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

1. Clone the project in you local machine.
2. Install the dependencies using `yarn install` or `npm install`.
3. Run the project using `yarn android` or `npm run android`.
4. You can also run the project using `yarn ios` or `npm run ios`.

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your assignment app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.
